## My Projects

Here are some of the key projects I have worked on, spanning **machine learning, biomedical signal processing, biomechanics and wearable devices**. This page is still under construction.

**Location:** FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg

**Description:** I developed a deep learning project from scratch, using no skeletons and no LLM's, as a part of the Deep Learning course given by Prof. Andreas Maier at FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg.
- Basic neural network layers, optimization techniques, and regularization methods are defined.
- These are used implement basic neural network architectures to do classification.
- The project is fully documented with Google-style docstring.

**Location:** FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg, Machine Learning and Data Analytics Lab

- I have completed research internship at Machine Learning and Data Analytics Lab at FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg on biomechanics.
- I investigated the effect of the leg length inequality on the biomechanical dynamics of human movement by running predictive gait simulations on MATLAB.

### Real-Time Parkinson's Tremor Detection Using Embedded AI
**Location:** Fraunhofer IIS, Medical Sensors and Analytics Group

**Description:** Worked on a hand stabilizer glove project that can mitigate Parkinson’s disease tremors as they start, that could improve the quality of life for Parkinson's patients.
- Trained and evaluated various algorithms from traditional Fourier transform-based algorithms to deep learning algorithms to detect Parkinson's tremors in real time.
- Selected algorithms are implemented on an embedded device through optimizations such as post-training quantization and pruning.
- Master's Thesis: Evaluation of Traditional and Machine Learning Algorithms for Real-time Parkinson's Tremor Detection

<small>Source: [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-illustration-of-forward-and-inverse-ECG-problems_fig2_344270543)</small>

**Location:** Middle East Technical University, Heart Research Laboratory

**Description:** The inverse problem of electrocardiography (ECG) is the problem of reconstructing electrical activity on the heart’s surface (epicardium) or even within the myocardium using body-surface potential measurements obtained from electrodes placed on the torso.

- Worked on the "ClinECGI" project, evaluating the performance of noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging for localizing premature ventricular contractions.
- Applied registration and interpolation methods to transfer epicardial data between geometries in MATLAB.
- Solved the inverse problem of electrocardiography using Bayesian MAP estimation with simulated epicardial data.
- Explored Bayesian estimation methods for inverse electrocardiographic imaging, focusing on prior model selection and noise reduction techniques.

**Conference Papers:**
