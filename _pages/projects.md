## My Projects

Here are some of the key projects I have worked on, spanning **machine learning, biomedical signal processing**. This page is still under construction.

### üß† Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)
**Project:** Neural Signal Decoding for Motor Control  
- Developed an ML model to decode **high-density EMG recordings** for robotic hand control.
- Optimized model performance for **embedded deployment**.

### üî¨ Biomedical Signal Processing
**Project:** Parkinson's Tremor Detection with Deep Learning  
- Designed a **real-time tremor classification model** for wearable devices.
- Implemented **CNNs and frequency-based feature extraction**.

### üè° Smart Buildings & Sustainability
**Project:** Intelligent Energy Optimization in Buildings  
- Used **AI-driven predictive models** for optimizing HVAC energy use.
- Implemented scenario-based simulations to enhance energy efficiency.

### üå± IoT in Agriculture
**Project:** Smart Greenhouse Management System  
- Developed an **IoT-based climate control system** for greenhouse farming.
- Integrated **Edge AI** for real-time environmental adjustments.
