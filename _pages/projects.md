## My Projects

Here are some of the key projects I have worked on, spanning **machine learning, biomedical signal processing**. This page is still under construction.

### Deep Learning From Scratch
**Description:** I developed a deep learning project from scratch, using no skeletons and no LLM's.
- Each neural network layer and methods for forward and backward pass are defined.
- These are used to solve some basic classification tasks.

Check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/egeozkoc/DeepLearning) of the project!

### ðŸ”¬ Biomedical Signal Processing
**Project:** Parkinson's Tremor Detection with Deep Learning  
- Designed a **real-time tremor classification model** for wearable devices.
- Implemented **CNNs and frequency-based feature extraction**.

More projects will be added soon! Stay tuned.
