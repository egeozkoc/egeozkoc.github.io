## My Projects

Here are some of the key projects I have worked on, spanning **machine learning, biomedical signal processing, biomechanics and wearable devices**. This page is still under construction.

### Deep Learning From Scratch
![Neural Network](../assets/images/neural_network.jpeg)
**Description:** I developed a deep learning project from scratch, using no skeletons and no LLM's, as a part of the Deep Learning course given by Prof. Andreas Maier at FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg.
- Basic neural network layers, optimization techniques, regularization methods, and recurrent layers are defined.
- These are used implement basic neural network architectures to do classification.

Check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/egeozkoc/DeepLearning) of the project.

### Predictive Gait Simulations of Leg Length Inequality

- I have completed research internship at Machine Learning and Data Analytics Lab at FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg on predictive gait simulations of leg length inequality.

Here is my [internship report](../assets/docs/PredictiveGaitSimulationsofLegLengthInequalityReport.pdf).



### Real-Time Parkinson's Tremor Detection Using Embedded AI
**Description:** Parkinson's Tremor Detection
- Designed a **real-time tremor classification model** for wearable devices.
- Implemented **CNNs and frequency-based feature extraction**.

More projects will be added soon! Stay tuned.
