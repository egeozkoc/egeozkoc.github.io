I specialize in machine learning, signal processing, and biomedical engineering, with a BSc in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from METU and an MSc in Medical Engineering from FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg. I have experience in pattern recognition, deep learning, Edge AI, and biomedical signal/image analysis (ECG, EMG, MRI) using MATLAB, Python, and C/C++. I am passionate about AI-driven healthcare solutions and aim to leverage advanced computational methods to improve medical diagnostics and patient outcomes.
